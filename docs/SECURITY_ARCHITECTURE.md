# Eventra Security Architecture

This document describes the security architecture of Eventra, detailing the design, patterns, and protocols enforced to protect the application and its users.

---

## 1. Authentication Flow

Eventra enforces cookie-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) stored in secure, `HttpOnly` cookies. The client never handles the raw token directly in Javascript, mitigating Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) token exfiltration risks.

### 1.1 Fail-Closed Security

**CRITICAL**: Eventra enforces fail-closed security for JWT authentication. The `JWT_SECRET` environment variable is mandatory with NO fallback secret.

- If `JWT_SECRET` is missing, empty, or whitespace-only:
  - Build-time validation fails with a critical security error
  - Runtime token signing throws an error
  - Edge middleware returns HTTP 500 for protected routes
  - SSE mock server fails to start with a fatal error
  - RBAC is NEVER bypassed

This prevents unauthorized access when configuration is incomplete.

    API->>Store: Lookup User / Compare Password (BCrypt)
    Store-->>API: User Verified
    API->>API: Sign JWT with JWT_SECRET (Mandatory)
    API-->>Client: 200/201 JSON (Set-Cookie: token=JWT; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict; Secure)
    
    Note over Client, API: Subsequent requests carry the cookie automatically
    
    Client->>API: GET /api/protected-route (Carries Token Cookie)
    API->>API: verifyAuth Middleware checks signature and expiry
    API->>Store: Confirm user is active and exists
    API-->>Client: 200 JSON (Protected Resource)
    
    Client->>API: POST /api/auth/logout
    API-->>Client: Set-Cookie: token=; Max-Age=0 (Clears Cookie)
```

## 2. Token Lifecycle & Session Management

- **Short Access Token Expiration**: The JWT default lifetime (`JWT_EXPIRES_IN`) is set to `1h` (1 hour). This limits the exposure window of any intercepted session token.
- **Dynamic Cookie Attributes**:
  - `HttpOnly`: Access blocked to `document.cookie` from script space.
  - `SameSite=Strict`: Prevents the cookie from being sent on cross-site requests, mitigating Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
  - `Secure`: Cookie only transmitted over HTTPS connections (enforced in production).
  - `Max-Age`: Computed dynamically based on `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` to ensure cookie and JWT lifetimes match.
- **Revocation and User Existence Checks**:
  - The `verifyAuth` middleware does not rely solely on cryptographic validation of the token payload.
  - On every authenticated request, the middleware looks up the user in the store (`usersById` or `users`) and checks that `user.isActive !== false` before authorizing the request. This ensures suspended or deleted accounts lose access immediately.

## 3. Rate Limiting Strategy

Eventra protects resource-intensive API paths (like authentication and LLM recommendation probes) using a distributed rate limiter keyed by client IP.

### 3.1 Distributed Rate Limiting

**CRITICAL**: Eventra enforces distributed rate limiting in production to prevent brute-force attacks and credential stuffing across multiple server instances.

- **Fixed-Window Limiter**: Uses atomic Redis/KV operations to track request counts per IP within time windows. Prevents race conditions through atomic INCR operations.
- **Distributed Storage**: Rate limit counters are shared across all instances using:
  - **Vercel KV** (REST API) - for Vercel deployments
  - **Upstash Redis** (ioredis) - for general Redis deployments
  - **Standard Redis** (ioredis) - for self-hosted Redis
  - **In-memory** (development/test only) - NOT suitable for production
- **Fail-Closed Security**: In production, if distributed storage is required but unavailable, requests are rejected with a 500 error rather than silently bypassing rate limiting.
- **Atomic Operations**: Uses Redis Lua scripts or KV REST API atomic operations to prevent race conditions during concurrent requests.

### 3.2 Configuration

Environment variables control rate limiting behavior:

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RATE_LIMIT_REDIS_URL` | Production (one of) | Redis connection URL for distributed rate limiting |
| `KV_REST_API_URL` | Production (one of) | Upstash Redis REST API URL (Vercel KV migrated to Upstash) |
| `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` | Production (with KV) | Upstash Redis REST API token |
| `RATE_LIMIT_MODE` | Optional | Override mode: "distributed" (default in prod) or "memory" (dev/test only) |

**Production Setup**:
- Set at least one of `RATE_LIMIT_REDIS_URL` or `KV_REST_API_URL`/`KV_REST_API_TOKEN`
- Build-time validation FAILS if missing in production
- Runtime rejects requests if misconfigured
- `RATE_LIMIT_MODE=memory` is NOT allowed in production

**Development Setup**:
- Falls back to in-memory storage automatically
- Can explicitly set `RATE_LIMIT_MODE=memory` for testing
- No distributed storage required

### 3.3 Rate Limit Configurations

- **Login Route**: Limited to 10 requests per minute per IP.
- **Signup Route**: Limited to 5 requests per minute per IP.
- **General APIs**: Throttled using Edge Middleware / Vercel KV REST API at the routing boundary (60 requests per minute).

### 3.4 Security Properties

- **Shared State**: Counters persist across serverless cold starts and container restarts
- **Multi-Instance Safety**: All instances enforce the same limits using shared storage
- **Race Condition Prevention**: Atomic operations prevent concurrent request bypass
- **Fail-Secure**: Production rejects requests when rate limiting is unavailable rather than disabling protection

## 4. Content Security Policy (CSP)

Global security headers are defined in `vercel.json` to prevent injection attacks and MIME-sniffing:

- `Content-Security-Policy`: Disallows unauthorized scripts, styles, or frames.
  - `default-src 'self'`: Default fallback to trusted local origin.
  - `script-src 'self' https://accounts.google.com https://cdn.jsdelivr.net`: Restricts executable scripts.
  - `style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com`: Restricts styling vectors.
  - `object-src 'none'`: Blocks Flash and Java applets.
  - `frame-ancestors 'none'`: Prevents clickjacking by blocking rendering in `<iframe>`, `<frame>`, or `<embed>`.
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`: Global frame prevention.
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`: Enforces correct MIME types to prevent script execution via non-JS file uploads.
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`: Controls referrer leakage.

---

## 5. Input Sanitization Guidelines

Always choose the appropriate helper for the context of user input:

| Helper Function | Target Use Case | Actions Taken |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `sanitizeHtml` | Rich Text / Descriptions (for rendering via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`) | Cleans HTML tags against a whitelist; blocks `javascript:`/`data:` protocols; strips event handlers (`onerror`, `onload`). |
| `sanitizeInputText` | Plain text inputs (form fields) | Escapes special characters (`<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, `'`) to safe HTML entities. |
| `sanitizeSearchQuery` | Search queries / API parameters | Strips all HTML, tags, query operators, and truncates queries to 200 characters to prevent ReDoS / NoSQL injection. |

---

## 6. CSRF Protection

For state-changing actions (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE), the frontend attaches a unique, session-bound token:

1. The CSRF token is obtained via `getCSRFToken()`, which checks the meta tag first, then cookies.
2. Frontend requests append the token to the `X-CSRF-Token` header.
3. The server validates this token against the request session, rejecting mismatched requests with `403 Forbidden`.

### Token Sources

The CSRF token can be provided through two sources (checked in order):

1. **Meta Tag**: `<meta name="csrf-token" content="TOKEN_VALUE">` in `index.html`
2. **Cookie**: `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie (or custom name via `getCSRFTokenFromCookie(name)`)

### Enforcement Modes

CSRF protection behavior is configurable via the `VITE_CSRF_ENFORCEMENT_MODE` environment variable:

- **warning** (default): Logs missing CSRF tokens to console (structured JSON in production) but allows requests to proceed. Suitable for gradual rollout or development.
- **strict**: Blocks requests when CSRF token is missing by throwing a `CSRFError`. Recommended for production environments with complete CSRF token setup.
- **disabled**: Disables CSRF protection entirely. Not recommended except for specific legacy scenarios.

### Configuration

Set the enforcement mode in `.env` or `.env.local`:

```bash
VITE_CSRF_ENFORCEMENT_MODE=strict
```

### Production Visibility

Missing CSRF tokens are logged using structured logging in production:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "event": "csrf_token_missing",
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "/api/events",
  "enforcementMode": "warning"
}
```

This allows monitoring and alerting on CSRF token issues without exposing sensitive token values.

### API Integration

The request interceptor in `src/config/api/interceptors.js` automatically:

- Checks if the request method requires CSRF protection
- Validates token presence based on enforcement mode
- Attaches the token to the `X-CSRF-Token` header when present
- Throws `CSRFError` in strict mode when token is missing
- Logs security events for monitoring

### Error Handling

When a request is blocked due to missing CSRF token (strict mode), a `CSRFError` is thrown with:

- Message: "CSRF token required for {METHOD} request. Please ensure the CSRF token is available in the meta tag or cookie."
- Status: 403
- Integrates with the existing API error handling system

## 7. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Policy

Eventra enforces a strict allowlist-based CORS policy to prevent unauthorized cross-origin access to API endpoints.

### 7.1 Allowlist-Based Origin Validation

**CRITICAL**: Eventra does not use wildcard (`*`) CORS origins. All origins must be explicitly allowed through the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable.

- Origins are validated against a comma-separated allowlist
- Only trusted origins receive `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers
- Untrusted origins receive no CORS headers (fail closed)
- Exact string matching is used (no regex patterns)
- `Vary: Origin` is always returned to prevent caching issues

### 7.2 Configuration

Set allowed origins via the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable:

```env
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://eventra.com,https://www.eventra.com,https://api.eventra.com
```

**Security Requirements:**
- Never use wildcard (`*`) in production
- Specify exact origins including protocol (http/https) and port if non-standard
- Origins are case-sensitive and must match exactly
- Whitespace around origins is automatically trimmed

### 7.3 Development Support

In non-production environments (`NODE_ENV !== "production"`), common localhost origins are automatically allowed for development convenience:

- `http://localhost:3000`
- `http://localhost:5173`
- `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
- `http://127.0.0.1:5173`

**Security Note**: These development origins are **blocked** in production unless explicitly added to `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.

### 7.4 Fail-Closed Behavior

When an origin is not in the allowlist:

- No `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header is returned
- The browser blocks the cross-origin request
- No error message is leaked to the client
- This prevents information disclosure about allowed origins

### 7.5 Implementation Details

The CORS policy is implemented in `api/auth/cors.js`:

- `getAllowedOrigins()`: Parses and validates the environment variable
- `isAllowedOrigin(origin)`: Checks if an origin is trusted
- `buildCorsHeaders(req)`: Generates CORS headers for requests

All functions include comprehensive test coverage in `src/__tests__/corsProtection.test.js`.

## 8. Persistent Authentication Storage Requirements

**CRITICAL**: Eventra enforces fail-closed security for authentication storage. In-memory user storage is permitted ONLY in development environments.

### 8.1 Storage Architecture

Eventra uses a **storage abstraction layer** (`api/auth/user-storage.js`) that provides a unified interface for user storage operations. This layer supports multiple backends:

- **Development/Testing**: In-memory Map backend (no database required)
- **Production**: Redis backend (using `DATABASE_URL` or `KV_REST_API_URL`)

The storage abstraction provides the following operations:
- `createUser()` - Create a new user
- `getUserByEmail()` - Retrieve user by email
- `getUserByUsername()` - Retrieve user by username
- `getUserById()` - Retrieve user by ID
- `updateUser()` - Update user fields
- `deleteUser()` - Delete a user
- `isStorageHealthy()` - Check storage health status

### 8.2 Production Storage Requirements

- **DATABASE_URL or KV_REST_API_URL is mandatory in production**: The application will fail to start if neither is configured when `NODE_ENV=production`.
- **Redis backend**: Production uses Redis for persistent storage via the `ioredis` client.
- **No fallback to in-memory storage**: Production never falls back to Map-based storage. This prevents silent account loss after server restarts or serverless cold starts.
- **Fail-fast initialization**: The storage backend validates configuration during initialization, rejecting startup before accepting any requests.
- **Runtime protection**: Authentication endpoints return HTTP 500 with a generic "Authentication service unavailable" error if persistent storage is not healthy.

### 8.3 Development Storage

- In-memory Map storage is used when `NODE_ENV` is not `production` (development, test, etc.).
- This preserves existing development and test workflows without requiring database setup.
- The storage abstraction layer automatically selects the appropriate backend based on environment.

### 8.4 Security Rationale

- **Prevents account loss**: Without persistent storage, all user accounts vanish on server restart, causing 401 authentication failures for previously valid credentials.
- **Serverless compatibility**: Serverless platforms (Vercel, AWS Lambda) have cold starts that reset in-memory state. Persistent storage is required for production deployments.
- **Fail-closed design**: The application refuses to operate in an unsafe configuration rather than silently accepting data that will be lost.
- **Storage abstraction**: By using a unified storage interface, authentication logic is decoupled from storage implementation, making it easier to swap backends or add new storage providers.

### 8.5 Configuration

Set `DATABASE_URL` or `KV_REST_API_URL` in your production environment:

```bash
# Required in production (Redis connection string)
DATABASE_URL=redis://user:password@host:6379

# OR use Vercel KV
KV_REST_API_URL=https://your-kv-store.redis.com
KV_REST_API_TOKEN=your-kv-token
```

The validation script (`scripts/validate-env.js`) enforces this requirement during build time in production.

### 8.6 Storage Backend Implementation Details

#### In-Memory Backend (Development)
- Uses JavaScript `Map` objects for storage
- Supports all CRUD operations
- Data is lost on process restart (acceptable for development)
- No external dependencies required

#### Redis Backend (Production)
- Uses `ioredis` client for Redis connections
- Implements connection pooling and retry logic
- Stores user data as JSON strings
- Maintains indexes for email, username, and ID lookups
- Supports automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Data persists across restarts and deployments

#### Storage Key Schema (Redis)
- User data: `auth:user:{id}` → JSON user object
- Email index: `auth:user:email:{email}` → user ID
- Username index: `auth:user:username:{username}` → user ID
