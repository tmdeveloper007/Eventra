# Eventra API Documentation

## 📖 Prerequisites

Before working with the API, ensure your environment is properly configured:

**\u2705 [Environment Setup Guide](ENV_SETUP_GUIDE.md)** – Complete configuration instructions including:

- Backend API URL configuration (`BACKEND_URL`, `VITE_API_URL`, or `REACT_APP_API_URL`)
- Running the backend locally
- Troubleshooting connection issues
- Mock API vs real API modes

---

## Overview

Eventra provides a RESTful backend API built using Spring Boot and secured using JWT Authentication.

The APIs support:

- User authentication
- Event management
- Public and protected endpoint access
- Structured error handling
- Swagger/OpenAPI integration

**For detailed information on authentication flows, role-based access control, and how permissions work, see the [Architecture & Roles Guide](ARCHITECTURE_AND_ROLES.md#-route-protection--authentication-flow).**

---

# Swagger/OpenAPI Documentation

## Production Swagger UI

```bash
https://eventra-backend-springboot-eybhdvaubxcua7ha.centralindia-01.azurewebsites.net/swagger-ui/index.html
```

---

## Local Swagger UI

After starting the Spring Boot backend locally:

```bash
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
```

If the backend runs on another port (example: `8081`), replace the port accordingly.

---

# Authentication Flow

Eventra uses JWT-based authentication.

## Step 1 — Register User

### Endpoint

```bash
POST /api/auth/signup
```

### Request Body

```json
{
  "firstName": "john",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "confirmPassword": "password123"
}
```

---

## Step 2 — Login User

### Endpoint

```bash
POST /api/auth/login
```

### Request Body

```json
{
  "usernameOrEmail": "john@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

---

## Alternative: Google OAuth Login

### Endpoint

```bash
POST /api/auth/google
```

### Request Body

```json
{
  "credential": "GOOGLE_ID_TOKEN_FROM_GOOGLE_OAUTH"
}
```

---

## Step 3 — Copy JWT Token

Successful login returns:

```json
{
  "token": "JWT_TOKEN",
  "tokenType": "Bearer",
  "id": 1,
  "firstName": "john",
  "lastName": "doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "username": "john",
  "role": "CLIENT"
}
```

---

## Step 4 — Authorize Swagger

Click the **Authorize** button in Swagger UI and enter:

```bash
Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
```

Example:

```bash
Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...
```

## Example 404 Response

```json
{
  "status": 404,
  "error": "Not Found",
  "message": "Event not found with id: 888",
  "path": "/api/events/888",
  "timestamp": "2026-05-19T12:20:31"
}
```

# Frontend Integration Notes

Frontend applications should:

- Store JWT tokens securely
- Send tokens using the `Authorization` header
- Handle structured API error responses
- Use Swagger UI for endpoint testing during development

Example authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
```

---

# Benefits of Swagger Integration

- Interactive API testing
- Faster frontend-backend integration
- Better onboarding for contributors
- Centralized API reference
- Easier debugging and maintenance
- Improved development workflow

---

# Contributor API Integration Guide

## Frontend ↔ Backend Communication Flow

The Eventra frontend communicates with the Spring Boot backend through HTTP requests.

```text
Frontend Component
↓
API Service Layer
↓
Backend API
↓
Database
↓
Response
↓
Frontend UI Update
```

This flow should be followed when integrating new backend functionality into frontend features.

---

## Environment Configuration

Before making API requests, ensure the frontend is configured with the correct backend URL.

Common environment variables:

```env
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

Refer to the Environment Setup Guide for complete configuration details.

---

## Authentication in Frontend

Protected endpoints require a JWT token.

Example Authorization header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
```

Frontend applications should:

- Store JWT tokens securely
- Attach tokens to protected requests
- Handle token expiration gracefully
- Redirect users to login when authentication fails

---

## API Integration Best Practices

When adding new API integrations:

1. Keep API logic separate from UI components.
2. Reuse existing API utility functions whenever possible.
3. Use environment variables instead of hardcoded URLs.
4. Handle API errors consistently.
5. Validate API responses before updating UI state.

---

## Adding New API Endpoints

Recommended workflow:

1. Verify backend endpoint availability.
2. Test the endpoint using Swagger.
3. Create frontend service/API functions.
4. Connect the service to components or state management.
5. Handle loading and error states.
6. Verify end-to-end functionality.

---

## Error Handling Recommendations

Frontend implementations should:

- Display user-friendly error messages.
- Handle network failures gracefully.
- Handle `401 Unauthorized` responses.
- Handle `403 Forbidden` responses.
- Log unexpected errors during development.

Example:

- `401 Unauthorized` → Redirect to Login
- `403 Forbidden` → Show Permission Error
- `404 Not Found` → Show Resource Not Found Message
- `500 Server Error` → Show Generic Error Message
