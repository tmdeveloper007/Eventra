## Overview

Eventra is an open-source frontend application built with React and Vite. It supports event discovery, registration, dashboards, hackathons, collaboration features, feedback flows, and role-based access experiences.

This repository contains the frontend application. The Spring Boot backend is maintained in a separate repository — all API traffic is proxied to it both in production (via Vercel rewrites) and in local development (via Vite proxy).

- Frontend repo: <https://github.com/SandeepVashishtha/Eventra>
- Backend repo: <https://github.com/SandeepVashishtha/Eventra-Backend>
- Backend API base: <https://eventra-backend-springboot-eybhdvaubxcua7ha.centralindia-01.azurewebsites.net>
- Swagger: <https://eventra-backend-springboot-eybhdvaubxcua7ha.centralindia-01.azurewebsites.net/swagger-ui/index.html>

## Project Architecture

Below is the high-level architecture of Eventra:

    Client --> State[State: Context/Hooks]
    Client --> Backend[Backend: Spring Boot API]
    Backend --> Azure[Azure Spring Boot]
    Client -.-> VercelRewrite[Vercel /api/* Rewrite]

    Auth --> Protected[Protected Routes]
    Protected --> RoleCheck[Role-Based Access]
    RoleCheck --> OrgDash[Organizer Dashboard]
    RoleCheck --> UserDash[User Dashboard]
```

### Frontend–Backend Communication

- The React app communicates with the Spring Boot backend via REST API calls.
- In production, `/api/*` requests are rewritten to the Azure-hosted backend via Vercel rewrites.
- In development, Vite proxies API calls to `http://localhost:8080` (see `vite.config.js`).
- Backend URL resolution priority: `BACKEND_URL` → `VITE_API_URL` → `REACT_APP_API_URL` (configured in `src/config/backendConfig.js`).

### Authentication Flow

- JWT-based authentication handled via Edge Middleware and context providers.
- Protected routes check for valid tokens before rendering; unauthenticated users are redirected to login.
- Role-aware behavior distinguishes organizers, contributors, and viewers.
- The server-side `JWT_SECRET` environment variable is used for token signing and validation.

### Route Protection

- Route-level guards in `src/components/` enforce authentication and role requirements.
- Public routes (home, events, hackathons) are accessible without authentication.
- Protected routes (dashboards, organizer panels) require a valid JWT and optionally specific roles.
- Middleware runs at the edge for production builds, validating tokens before requests reach the app.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js `>=22.x`
- npm `>=9.6.4`

## Local Development

1. Clone and install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SandeepVashishtha/Eventra.git
cd Eventra
npm install
```

1. Create your env file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
> **Tip:** If your operating system does not support `cp`, copy the file manually or use `copy .env.example .env` on Windows.

1. Start dev server:

npm run dev

App runs at `http://localhost:3000` (configured in `vite.config.js`).

## Common Setup Issues

### Dependency Installation Warnings

Some users may see peer dependency or engine warnings during `npm install`. In most cases, the installation still completes successfully.

If installation fails, try:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### Port Already in Use

If port `3000` is already occupied, stop the existing process or run:

```bash
npx kill-port 3000
```

### Vite Cache Issues

If the frontend shows unexpected build or parsing errors, clear the Vite cache and restart the server:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
npm run dev
```

For Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules/.vite
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variable Issues

Make sure `.env` is created correctly from `.env.example` before starting the development server.

## Docker Development

You can run Eventra fully containerized using Docker Compose to ensure a consistent environment:

1. Clone the repository and setup your environment variables:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SandeepVashishtha/Eventra.git
cd Eventra
cp .env.example .env
```

1. Start the local development container:

```bash
docker compose up eventra-dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000` with hot-reloading enabled.

1. Build and test the production container locally:

```bash
docker compose up --build eventra-prod
```

The production-optimized build will be served via Nginx at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Environment Variables

Use `.env.example` as the source of truth. See [docs/ENV_SETUP_GUIDE.md](docs/ENV_SETUP_GUIDE.md) for detailed configuration information.

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BACKEND_URL` | No | Backend origin (highest priority, overrides others) |
| `VITE_API_URL` | No | Backend API base URL (Vite - preferred) |
| `REACT_APP_API_URL` | No | Backend API base URL (CRA compatibility) |
| `REACT_APP_GITHUB_REPO` | No | Public repo identifier used in metadata |
| `REACT_APP_PUBLIC_URL` | No | Canonical public app URL |
| `REACT_APP_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` | No | Public web-push key |
| `REACT_APP_CSP_REPORT_URI` | No | CSP report endpoint |
| `REACT_APP_SENTRY_DSN` | No | Sentry browser error reporting DSN, used only in production |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Yes (server-side) | JWT signing secret for Edge Middleware auth verification |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes (server-side, production) | Database connection URL for persistent authentication storage |
| `KV_REST_API_URL` | Yes (server-side, production) | Vercel KV/Redis REST API URL for distributed rate limiting |
| `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` | Yes (server-side, production) | Vercel KV/Redis REST API token for distributed rate limiting |
| `BLOCKED_COUNTRIES` | No (server-side) | Comma-separated ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes to block |

Examples:

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com
```

or:

```env
BACKEND_URL=https://api.example.com
```

**Backend Configuration**: All backend endpoint configuration is centralized in `src/config/backendConfig.js`. The system resolves backend URLs in priority order: `BACKEND_URL` → `VITE_API_URL` → `REACT_APP_API_URL`. In development, defaults to `http://localhost:8080`. In production, no automatic fallback - configuration must be explicitly set to avoid configuration drift.

Security note: never place private secrets in `REACT_APP_*` or `VITE_*` variables because they are exposed to the client bundle.

### Geographic Access Restrictions

The Edge Middleware supports configurable country-based access restrictions via the `BLOCKED_COUNTRIES` environment variable. This is a server-side configuration that affects all incoming requests.

**Configuration:**
- Set `BLOCKED_COUNTRIES` to a comma-separated list of two-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes
- Leave empty to allow access from all countries (default behavior)
- Country codes are case-insensitive and whitespace is trimmed automatically

**Examples:**
```env
# Block specific countries
BLOCKED_COUNTRIES=CU,IR,KP,SY,RU

# Allow all countries (default)
BLOCKED_COUNTRIES=
```

**Behavior:**
- Requests from blocked countries receive HTTP 451 (Unavailable For Legal Reasons)
- Blocked requests are logged with the country code for monitoring
- Self-hosted deployments can configure this based on their requirements
- No restrictions are applied when the variable is empty or unset

## SSE Mock Server (Optional)

For local realtime testing:

```bash
node sse-mock-server.js
```

- `JWT_SECRET` - JWT signing secret for token generation and validation. Generate with: `openssl rand -base64 32`

Optional environment flags:

- `SSE_MOCK_PORT` (default `8080`)
- `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` (default `http://localhost:3000`)
- `SSE_DEBUG` (`true` or `false`)

## Deployment

Vercel configuration is checked in via [`vercel.json`](vercel.json):

- Build command: `npm run lint && GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false npm run build`
- Output directory: `build`
- `/api/*` is rewritten to the hosted Spring Boot backend (the sole API provider)
- No serverless functions are deployed — the `api/` directory was removed as dead code
