# Pre-commit Hooks: Husky + lint-staged

This project uses [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged) to automatically lint and format code before every commit.

## How it works

When you run `git commit`, Husky triggers the `pre-commit` hook which runs `lint-staged`. Only **staged files** are checked, keeping the process fast.

### What runs on commit

| File type | Actions |
|-----------|---------|
| `*.js, *.jsx, *.ts, *.tsx` | ESLint --fix, Prettier --write |
| `*.css, *.json, *.md` | Prettier --write |

If ESLint finds errors that cannot be auto-fixed, the commit is **blocked** until they are resolved.

## Setup (automatic)

After cloning and running `npm install`, Husky is automatically configured via the `prepare` script.

```bash
npm install   # husky is set up automatically
```

## Manual trigger

You can manually run the checks at any time:

```bash
# Lint all files
npm run lint

# Auto-fix lint issues
npm run lint:fix

# Format all files
npm run format
```

## Bypass (not recommended)

In rare cases where you need to skip the hook:

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "your message"
```

> ⚠️ Use `--no-verify` only when absolutely necessary. It bypasses all pre-commit checks.
